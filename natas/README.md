# Natas


### Introduction

The Nata challenges are made to test some server-side and web-applications
vulnerabilities that are commonly found in WebApps. 
It should be noted that many sites suggest to have solved most natas before 
starting your **OSCP**.

Some of these are multiple types of injection, weak passwords etc.

This repo is made to help people understand how to write automated scripts
to solve these challenges. Each file is isolated and is to be run by itself.

The main reason as to why I created this repo is for me to apply some of the Python
knowledge I've had on hand since the last few months into something I love (PenTesting).
